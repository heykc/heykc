# Hey, I'm Keith! Welcome to my Github 👋

## Currently Working On
A short list of what I'm cookin' up at any given moment.

### Chain-Letter
Chain-letter allows users to chain snippets of text to create a collaborative storyline. Add your own story link to any existing link in a chain, or start a brand new story by making the first link in a new chain. Read any story from the beginning of the chain and choose your own adventure from link to link. 

Chain-Letter is a small, collaborative project built by a group of developers looking to make interesting resume boosters while learning the ins and outs of common development workflows like git flow, linters, pair programming, code reviews, and PR submission. 

### Die Ghost
Die Ghost is a top-down, 2D, multiplayer video game where you and your opponents are ghosts in a graveyard trying to unearth each other's bones. Move your bones from grave to grave but don't lose track of where they are as all movement occurs underground. You wouldn't want to unearth your own bones!

Die Ghost is a solo project built using the Defold engine and predominately programmed in Lua.

### About Me
I'm a web, app, and game developer based in Denver, CO 🌄.
